I am currently a graduate student at IIT Delhi. My research interest is at the intersection of Computer Vision, Embedded Systems and Machine Learning. I like to build hardware, find algorithms and solve problems.
This blog is a means of sharing my research, some articles about things I find interesting, and, some personal views related to the world that we live in. 

My official webpage is [here](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~anupam/).
