Humans have been obsessed with capturing moments since a long time. At first, we captured images using pictures which were hand-drawn. As technology progressed, we started using films to capture light. Today, there are extremely efficient professional cameras for capturing scenes in different contexts and applications. The ubiquity of cameras is evident in our pockets, with each smartphone having multiple cameras on either side of the phone.
A camera captures an explosion of information. One can read text from images, recognize people and their emotions, interactions, context; the list goes on and on. Humans rely on the visual modality for a large number of tasks. This intelligence has, in-part, started to appear in artificial forms. The ability to read text, recognize people or record interactions has now started to come to machines. With the embodiment of these abilities, _cameras are on the verge of a revolution_.

In today's post, we are going to talk about different applications where intelligent cameras are set to make their mark. Traditionally, the field of embodied computer vision has been known as **Machine Vision**. [Automated Imaging Association](https://www.visiononline.org/) is one of the largest trade groups which works in Machine Vision. The association sets standard of imaging, interfaces and has notable companies as members.
