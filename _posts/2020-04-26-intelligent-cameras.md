Humans have been obsessed with capturing moments since a long time. At first, we captured images using pictures which were hand-drawn. As technology progressed, we started using films to capture light. Today, there are extremely efficient professional cameras for capturing scenes in different contexts and applications. The ubiquity of cameras is evident in our pockets, with each smartphone having multiple cameras on either side of the phone.

A camera captures an explosion of information. One can read text from images, recognize people and their emotions, interactions, context; the list goes on and on. Humans rely on the visual modality for a large number of tasks. This intelligence has, in-part, started to appear in artificial forms with the advances in computer vision. With the embodiment of these abilities, _cameras are on the verge of a revolution_. However, this is not an entirely new field. _Machine Vision_ has been an active area since [at least 2006](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=x_1IauK-M2cC&lpg=PA427&pg=PA427&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).

We use cameras as simply sensing devices which acquire a picture or record a video for us. But have you ever wished that it could do more? For example, you could ask your camera to
- Tell you when mother's home.
- Tell you if you saw an unidentified person knocking at your door.
- Tell you how many people passed through the street today?

Even from a privacy perspective, wouldn't you prefer that the actual image never left your camera and only gave you encrypted messages about the information that you want? This also significantly reduces the amount of data bandwidth required. We are heading into a reality that would make this possible. Let's see how.

Computer Vision has been on the rise for the past few years due to breakthrough work in Machine Learning and Deep Learning backed by the theoretical foundations of the computer vision field. One can now,

[comment]: In today's post, we are going to talk about different applications where intelligent cameras are set to make their mark. Traditionally, the field of embodied computer vision has been known as **Machine Vision**. [Automated Imaging Association](https://www.visiononline.org/) is one of the largest trade groups which works in Machine Vision. The association sets standard of imaging, interfaces and has notable companies as members.
