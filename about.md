I am currently a graduate student at IIT Delhi working on Embedded/Assistive Technologies.

In the past, I have worked at Qualcomm Bangalore Design Centre as a DFT Engineer, working primarily in MBIST (Memory Built In Self Test) and ATPG (Automatic Test Pattern Generation). These are techniques of testing a chip before it goes to the customer.

My research interest is in system level integration and optimization of hardware for Assistive Technology and in general, connected systems. I have fair amount of experience in Embedded Systems, which I gained during my B.E. from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology working at Centre for Electronics Design and Technology.

I believe there are a lot of daily life problems which can be solved with the help of technology and if technology could make life better for someone, it would be greatly satisfying for both the user and the designer.
